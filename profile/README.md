## Our goal

At [Teleconsys](https://www.teleconsys.it/) we try to make innovation simple and open. We are working on projects regarding next-generation technologies such as **Distributed Ledger Technologies** and **Blockchain**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Quantum Computing**. We want to share with the community some of the tools we develop in our journey toward digital innovation :rocket:

Stay tuned or get involved!

<div style="text-align: justify; position:relative; left:80px; width: 890px;"> <b>dOra</b> is a distributed oracle for decentralized applications. It is able to work as an oracle for DLTs' Smart Contracts, but can also provide multi-party computation on its own. It also offers distributed storage as a feature. We released a simple <a href="https://github.com/teleconsys/dora-storage-demo">demo</a> to test the <b>dOra</b>'s oracle and storage features.  </div>
